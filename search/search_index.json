In 2018 the mortgage company I was working for was looking to make a change away from their current reporting platform and didn't want to go back to using Excel based reports. I had looked at Microsoft Power BI before but never really had a reason to use it, so I dove in one weekend with a Excel data sheet and built out the first version of a projections report. My company loved how fast the turn around was and how customizable we could get with Power BI we decided to use Power BI as our reporting platform for the majority of our loan origination reports. Fast forward to today and I continue to build new reports and maintains over 20 reports in our Power BI platform. I truly believe that small to medium mortgage companies can have top level reporting using Power BI.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#contact-info","text":"Please feel free to reach out to me on any questions about any information found on this site or if you would like to talk about how to possible get Power BI up and going for your company.

I wanted create and easy to setup and use program that would create a Excel, with a few changes to some configuration files this application will create an Excel file with Encompass data ready to be used in any report. Note Always make sure to review and test any application you download before using in a production environment. BitBucket links for source code for this application will be provided later in this write up. Source Code and Downloads Source Code A ReadMe file with full dependencies can be found using the below BitBucket link below: Source on BitBucket To download a zip copy of the source code to review or compile please use the link below: Download from BitBucket Setup Make sure that you compile a copy of this application before trying to run it as there are configuration files that must be edited before the application will work properly. Dependencies To compile a copy of this application you will need a computer that is running the Encompass SDK. Included in the download folder is a \"support dlls\" folder which contains the ConfigManger dll that is used to encrypt the appSettings part of the application config file, so that no username or passwords a stored in plain text. For the other dependencies that are not Encompass or ConfigManger please use Nuget Manager to download the rest of the packages needed to compile. Note Links for each Nuget package can be found in the ReadMe file located on BitBucket using the link above. Configuration Files Once the application is compiled there are two configuration files that must be edit before it will work properly. The Simple_Report_Export.exe.Config file (you may need to show file extension on your computer to find this file) has the appSettings and OutputSettings sections which are used to tell the application information it will need to generate the report. The report_settings.json file provides the fields from Encompass to pull as part of the data, along with the information on how build the report criteria. Simple_Report_Export.exe.Config This file contains important information needed for the application to login to Encompass, as well settings for where to output the generating the excel file. Example of what this file will look like is: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name= \"OutputSettings\" type= \"System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler\" /> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version= \"v4.0\" sku= \".NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2\" /> </startup> <runtime> <NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy enabled= \"true\" /> </runtime> <appSettings> <add key= \"encServer\" value= \"https://BE123456.ea.elliemae.net/Encompass$BE123456\" /> <add key= \"encUsername\" value= \"Encompass Username\" /> <add key= \"encPassword\" value= \"Encaompss Password\" /> </appSettings> <OutputSettings> <add key= \"Path\" value = \"C:\\Report_Data\\\" /> <add key= \"FileName\" value = \"LOS_Data.xlsx\" /> </OutputSettings> </configuration> appSettings This section of the configuration file handles who and where this application will log into. On first run the application will encrypt this section of the configuration file so that no the Encompass information used to create an Encompass session is saved as plain text. Note When first running the application it may appear as if the application didn't do anything, this is when the encryption is happening. Running the application again with a encrypted configuration file will result in the application running completely if all other setting are correct. OutputSettings This section of the configuration file handles where and what the exported Excel file will be. The Path is the full folder path to where the Excel file should be saved. You must include the tailing \"\\\" to make sure that the correct folder is used. The FileName path is what the Excel file will be called on export. The \".xlsx\" extension must included for the file to save correctly. report_settings.json This file contains the information needed on what fields to use when pulling data from Encompass, along with information on how to build the report criteria. The two section in this file are the Fields section and the QuerySettings section. Fields Section The fields json object allows you to provide a description which will be used later as the column title in Excel, along with the ID of the field in Encompass that you wish to pull into your report. Example of the Fields section is: { \"Fields\" : [ { \"ID\" : \"364\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Number\" }, { \"ID\" : \"2\" , \"Desc\" : \"Total Loan Amount\" }, { \"ID\" : \"GUID\" , \"Desc\" : \"GUID\" }, { \"ID\" : \"LOANFOLDER\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Folder\" } ] } Note Please note that any fields you use must be part of the Encompass Reporting Data Base for the Excel file to generate. Tip The default description in the report_settings.json that is available on BitBucket match the ones needed for the Power BI templates on this site. Once you have updated the ID field to what makes sense from your system, the exported file will work for all current templates. QuerySettings Section Settings in this section define what query criterion will be used when the Excel document is generated. There are two properties that must be in this section, those being the StartDate and the ExcludedFolders. The StartDate can be a empty string (to use an empty string please input \"\" for the value of StartDate), if you with so pull all loans from the loan origination system. When the StartDate property is set (must be in the format \"01/01/2018\") all loans with a File Started Milestone date on or after that date will be pulled into the Excel file. Tip Limiting the amount of data pulled into this Excel fill will make the export happen quicker. This will also limit the data you have to work with in Power Bi when imported, make sure to set the StartDate to a comfortable number years that works for what your reporting needs are. The ExcludedFolders list must have at least have one folder listed in it. Loans in the folders listed will not be pulled into the Excel file. And example of the QuerySettings section is: \"QuerySettings\" : { \"StartDate\" : \"01/01/2018\" , \"ExcludedFolders\" : [ \"(Trash)\" , \"Testing Training\" , \"(Archive)\" ] } Tip Not all data in Encompass is useful in reports and it is easier just to not pull in that data instead of trying to model around it in Power BI. If you have a Testing and Training folder, it is a pretty good bet that loans in that folder will not be needed for reports and is safe to exclude from being exported to Excel. Example report_settings.json Below is a example of a full report_settings.json file: { \"Fields\" : [ { \"ID\" : \"GUID\" , \"Desc\" : \"GUID\" }, { \"ID\" : \"364\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Number\" }, { \"ID\" : \"LOANFOLDER\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Folder\" } ], \"QuerySettings\" : { \"StartDate\" : \"01/01/2018\" , \"ExcludedFolders\" : [ \"(Trash)\" , \"Testing_Training\" , \"(Archive)\" ] } } First Run Once the application has been compiled and the configuration files have been updated, double clicking on the Simple_Report.Export.exe. On first run it will encrypt the appSettings section of the Simple_Report_Export.exe.Config file. Any run after that will use the encrypted appSettings to create a connection with Encompass and try and generate an Excel file with the fields proved based on the criteria in the report_settings.json file. Troubleshooting In the same directory as where the Simple_Report_Export.exe application is, a simple_report_export.log file will be generated. This log file will include information each time the application is run allow for you to see if any errors occurred and troubleshoot as needed.

Thank you!","title":"Need Help"},{"location":"datasources/users/","text":"User Data Source Reason As your data grows or you start to pull in more data spanning more time you may run into a problem as shown in the screenshot below, where you have a user that has changed their name. What happens in Power BI is that because these are unique data points, it reflects that way in the visual creating, in this case, both a Jane A Doe and a Jane Doe bar in the graph: What this can cause is a skew when a users looks at the report, thinking that Jane only worked on 17 funded loans where in reality she actually worked on 29. Worse would be if users start questioning if the data is reliable. Luckily there are a couple of ways that this can be resolved. Users Table Before we can get into the actually ways to resolve this we are going to need to gather some data to help resolve the problem. What we are needing is a users table. This table will usually have one or multiple unique identification column, this could be a username or employee id, really anything that is unique to the user themselves. The table will also have the full name or the display name of the user. The goal of this is to have a table of data with users names we would like to display in a report that have a data point that is unique to that user. A good example of this would be getting a table of loan officers names with their corresponding NMLS number. Since the NMLS number is unique to an loan office, we now have a way to identify a user in a dataset based on that instead of using the loan officers name from the loan origination system (LOS) data. Resolutions The resolutions listed below are only a couple of ways that this can resolved. In an ideal world you would have your user table available with your LOS data and could create a dataset where the names are already set from the data source server. In most cases I have not found this possible, which is why I have had to use the resolutions below for different datasets. Relationships Once we have gotten our users with unique ids setup in a users table, we are ready to start working on solving for the same user showing up multiple times in our visuals. The easiest way to accomplish this, especially when you are only dealing with on set of users, is using relationships in Power BI. Relationships allows us to use the unique id for the user found in both the LOS data and on our users table to use the full name from the users table in visuals with data from our LOS. To setup you a relationship, once you have your LOS data and User table loaded, head over to the Model tab in Power BI desktop: Once that is open you will presented with a list your data sources, in this example I have a simple set of LOS data and a user table I created. Notice in both tables I have a UserID column. In the LOS_Data this column contains the unique id for the user that worked on a loan. In the User_Table the UserID column contains the unique ID mapped to the FullName of the user, so that I can use this name in my report visuals. To create the relationship simple drag the UserID from the users table to the UserID in th LOS data, Power Bi will do the rest and create the 1 to many relationship: Once create we can use the FullName field from the Users_Table when we need to display user names in a visual and it will be used instead of what is in the LOS data. Using the earlier example with Jane we are now able to create a bar graph that has all Jane's funded loan showing as her instead of being split between the two names that are in the LOS data: Lookup Column In some case you either have multiple users you need to replace in a visual (such as a matrix or table visual), or you have multiple visual on a page that has multiple user roles on it (such as the Funding Report's operations page). In this case using one user table will not work as you cannot have multiple relationships between the same tables. While you could have multiple user tables this could end up being a maintenance and resource nightmare. A simpler solution would be just to use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function to return the value from your users table. To do this we would create a custom column (click here if you need help creating a custom column) and then add the following code into the formula bar: User_Lookup = //Create a variable to store the looked up user, setting to blank if nothing is found VAR _userLookup = LOOKUPVALUE ( Users_Table [ FullName ], Users_Table [ UserID ], LOS_Data [ UserID ], BLANK ()) //If the user lookup is blank set this column to the LOS user name, else use the looked up full name RETURN IF ( ISBLANK ( _userLookup ), LOS_Data [ User ], _userLookup ) That is it, now you have a a column full of user names from the user table that can be used in visuals. The nice thing about this lookup is that if for some reason a user is not found int he user table then it will just default back to what is in the LOS data. This can be helpful if your LOS data sync regularly but the user table isn't updated as frequently. Conclusion Using a user table is a great way to make sure report is accurate and reliable for your end users. The relationship and lookup way of getting users are just a couple of ways I have used in the past to make sure my data is in a good state. There are many different ways that this could be accomplished but hopefully these two will help you in your data exploration.","title":"Users"},{"location":"datasources/users/#user-data-source","text":"","title":"User Data Source"},{"location":"datasources/users/#reason","text":"As your data grows or you start to pull in more data spanning more time you may run into a problem as shown in the screenshot below, where you have a user that has changed their name. What happens in Power BI is that because these are unique data points, it reflects that way in the visual creating, in this case, both a Jane A Doe and a Jane Doe bar in the graph: What this can cause is a skew when a users looks at the report, thinking that Jane only worked on 17 funded loans where in reality she actually worked on 29. Worse would be if users start questioning if the data is reliable. Luckily there are a couple of ways that this can be resolved.","title":"Reason"},{"location":"datasources/users/#users-table","text":"Before we can get into the actually ways to resolve this we are going to need to gather some data to help resolve the problem. What we are needing is a users table. This table will usually have one or multiple unique identification column, this could be a username or employee id, really anything that is unique to the user themselves. The table will also have the full name or the display name of the user. The goal of this is to have a table of data with users names we would like to display in a report that have a data point that is unique to that user. A good example of this would be getting a table of loan officers names with their corresponding NMLS number. Since the NMLS number is unique to an loan office, we now have a way to identify a user in a dataset based on that instead of using the loan officers name from the loan origination system (LOS) data.","title":"Users Table"},{"location":"datasources/users/#resolutions","text":"The resolutions listed below are only a couple of ways that this can resolved. In an ideal world you would have your user table available with your LOS data and could create a dataset where the names are already set from the data source server. In most cases I have not found this possible, which is why I have had to use the resolutions below for different datasets.","title":"Resolutions"},{"location":"datasources/users/#relationships","text":"Once we have gotten our users with unique ids setup in a users table, we are ready to start working on solving for the same user showing up multiple times in our visuals. The easiest way to accomplish this, especially when you are only dealing with on set of users, is using relationships in Power BI. Relationships allows us to use the unique id for the user found in both the LOS data and on our users table to use the full name from the users table in visuals with data from our LOS. To setup you a relationship, once you have your LOS data and User table loaded, head over to the Model tab in Power BI desktop: Once that is open you will presented with a list your data sources, in this example I have a simple set of LOS data and a user table I created. Notice in both tables I have a UserID column. In the LOS_Data this column contains the unique id for the user that worked on a loan. In the User_Table the UserID column contains the unique ID mapped to the FullName of the user, so that I can use this name in my report visuals. To create the relationship simple drag the UserID from the users table to the UserID in th LOS data, Power Bi will do the rest and create the 1 to many relationship: Once create we can use the FullName field from the Users_Table when we need to display user names in a visual and it will be used instead of what is in the LOS data. Using the earlier example with Jane we are now able to create a bar graph that has all Jane's funded loan showing as her instead of being split between the two names that are in the LOS data:","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"datasources/users/#lookup-column","text":"In some case you either have multiple users you need to replace in a visual (such as a matrix or table visual), or you have multiple visual on a page that has multiple user roles on it (such as the Funding Report's operations page). In this case using one user table will not work as you cannot have multiple relationships between the same tables. While you could have multiple user tables this could end up being a maintenance and resource nightmare. A simpler solution would be just to use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function to return the value from your users table. To do this we would create a custom column (click here if you need help creating a custom column) and then add the following code into the formula bar: User_Lookup = //Create a variable to store the looked up user, setting to blank if nothing is found VAR _userLookup = LOOKUPVALUE ( Users_Table [ FullName ], Users_Table [ UserID ], LOS_Data [ UserID ], BLANK ()) //If the user lookup is blank set this column to the LOS user name, else use the looked up full name RETURN IF ( ISBLANK ( _userLookup ), LOS_Data [ User ], _userLookup ) That is it, now you have a a column full of user names from the user table that can be used in visuals. The nice thing about this lookup is that if for some reason a user is not found int he user table then it will just default back to what is in the LOS data. This can be helpful if your LOS data sync regularly but the user table isn't updated as frequently.","title":"Lookup Column"},{"location":"datasources/users/#conclusion","text":"Using a user table is a great way to make sure report is accurate and reliable for your end users.

Althoguh your data may have dates in it, it is likely that those dates have gaps in them for weekends or holidays, an independent date table allows for DAX time intelligence functions to work properly and create accurate results. Creating a Date Table One of the easiest ways to create a date table, if you don't have one already built out, is to create a table inside of Power BI using DAX. To do this, in Power BI Desktop click on the Modeling Tab and select New table: This will open up the table formula bar: You can either create your own date table using DAX or use the code below as a started for your table. This code will create a table full of dates between the start and end dates. It will also format that date in different ways that can be used in different measures: Dates = //Make sure to start as January 1st of a year VAR _startDate = DATE ( 2013 , 1 , 1 ) //Make sure to end on December 31st of a year VAR _endDate = DATE ( 2022 , 12 , 31 ) RETURN ADDCOLUMNS ( CALENDAR ( _startDate , _endDate ), \"DateAsInteger\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYYMMDD\" ), \"YEAR\" , YEAR ([ Date ]), \"MonthNumber\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"MM\" ), \"YearMonthNumber\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY/MM\" ), \"YearMonthShort\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY/mmm\" ), \"MonthNameShort\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"mmm\" ), \"MonthNameLong\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"mmmm\" ), \"DayOfWeekNumber\" , WEEKDAY ([ Date ]), \"DayOfWeek\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"dddd\" ), \"DayOfWeekShort\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"ddd\" ), \"WeekNum\" , WEEKNUM ([ Date ]), \"WeekNumYear\" , WEEKNUM ([ Date ]) & \"-\" & FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY\" ), \"Quarter\" , \"Q\" & FORMAT ([ Date ], \"Q\" ), \"YearQuarter\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY\" ) & \"/Q\" & FORMAT ([ Date ], \"Q\" ) ) The final step to setting up a date table is setting the table as the default Date Table so that Power BI uses it for DAX time intellegence measures. To do this locate the Dates table created in the steps above in the Fields list on the right hand side of Power BI desktop.

This allows users to only have access to the data that they should be authorized to see. For loan origination data, RLS helps us ensure that users only have access to the same loans they would have access to the loan origination system. An example of this is to provide managers with access to specific cost centers in reports so that they only can see loan information for their region, area, or branch only. In the example below we will walk through the steps of create a role for the manager to cost center scenario. Although we are only working through the one scenario, it could be expand on to make reports that are filtered down to originators or production team level. Important Concepts Before we dig into the how to setup and use RLS its important to understand some concepts when looking at adding it to your system: How data is refreshed in your system. If you are using DirectQuery as your data source there are a few more things that you will need to consider verses importing your data. There are few Microsoft knowledge base articles that cover this, one being the main RLS by Microsoft. All templates from this site use import and can have RLS added to if needed. Multiple Datasets or Reports. Depending on how you wish to have your data setup and users accessing that data you may end up with multiple datasets or reports that display the same information but one with RLS and another that does not. Example of this happening is if you have an executive team that needs to see all loan data in the system vs a group of managers that only need to see the subset of cost centers they manage. How will data be access. Users can access data via the Power BI Desktop or the Power BI Service. We will be using the USERPRINCIPALNAME() DAX function to identify a user and apply the correct role for them. If the user is connecting via the Power BI Web Service then you may need to consider what level of access that users has to the workspace that the data/report is stored in, please see this Microsoft KBA on using RLS with workspaces. Setting Up RLS For the below examples we are going to reference the following tables: LOS Data Table Manager Table Identifying Users To enable us to know what data a user should have access to via RLS we need to identify the user that is accessing the report. Luckily Power BI's DAX has a built in function that helps us with this, the USERPRINCIPALNAME() function will return a users information in the user@example.com format. We can then use that to build a access list or apply it to a set of a data to restrict users based on their User Principal Name, you can see this in our Managers data in the EMAIL column. Note Please note that there is also a USERNAME() DAX function that will return the User Principal Name when published to the Power BI Service, but when used in the Power BI Desktop version the USERNAME() returns the user information in the DOMAIN\\User format where as the USERPRINCIPALNAME() will also return the user@example.com format making a little more consistent between versions. Tip You can create a report with a blank dataset that has a set of measures, one set to USERNAME() and the other set to USERPRINCIPALNAME() . Pulling these measures out into a card visual can help see what identity you are working with and act as a troubleshooting source later when you publish the report to the Power BI Web Service. Identifying Data When applying RLS we will need to setup a filter to ensure that the user only has access to data that they are suppose to. This means the data has to have some way to group or individual identify what data a user should see. Using the USERPRINCIPALNAME() we would need a email address that is tied to the user for each row they would be given access to. Keep in mind that the email must match what is returned by the USERPRINCIPALNAME() function. In the examples below we will be using cost center to create a group that users should have access to and then use Power BI's relationships to apply the security role. In the above data set we will be building relationships off the ORGID column. Setting Up RLS Role To setup a Role that will be used for RLS first click the Manage roles button on the Model ribbon. The Model ribbon can be found while in the Report View or on the Home ribbon while in the Data or Model view. The button looks like this: Click the Mange roles button will open the Manage roles box: From here the Create button is used to create a role and then write a DAX expression that is applied to the table we want to apply RLS to. Below is a Role called Manager, that is applied to the Managers table with the a DAX statement that compares the EMAIL column in the Managers table to the USERPRINCIPALNAME() to know which roles should be accessible to the user.. Clicking the Save button will save the role. Now when a user that is assigned to this role uses the dataset, the Managers table will apply RLS and only give access to those rows where the User Principal Name equals the email found in the EMAIL column. We now need to apply the same RLS not only to the Managers table but have it also flow over to the LOS Data table. Next we look at two different way to accomplish this. Setting up Many-To-Many relationship To create a Many-To-Many relationship go to the Model view in Power BI Desktop and drag the key column from one table to the table you wish to create the relationship with. In our example we will be creating a relationship on the ORGID columns. When we do this we will get a Create relationship pop-up confirming that we want to use the ORGID columns. There are a couple of things to note on this popup: Warning about the Many-To-Many cardinality being used, make sure to take a peek at the learn more link provided and understand what this could mean for you environment. If Many-To-Many does not work check out the next example using a bridge table instead. Under the Cross filter direction, we want to make sure to check the Apply security filter in both dicrection checkbox so that the Role applied to the Managers table will filter to the LOS Data table through the relationship. Once you click OK the model view will be updated like below showing the relationship line between the two tables: With this in place when a user accesses the dataset, the Manager role filters the Managers table down to the cost centers they have access to and that in turn (because of the Apply security filter checkbox) flows down to the LOS Data, making sure that the user only sees loan data for the cost centers they have been allowed to. Setting up RLS using a Bridge table An alternative to using a Many-To-Many relationship, is to build a bridge table that contains the unique values of your key fields and then connecting the tables through this new table. In our example we would create a bridge table that contains the ORGID only, using the following DAX statement: ORGID Only = CALCULATETABLE ( DISTINCT ( ' LOS Data ' [ ORGID ]), NOT ( ISBLANK ( ' LOS Data ' [ ORGID ]))) This would create a table called ORGID ONLY with all the unique (non-blank) ORGIDS from the LOS Data table: To create the relationships between the tables, we drag the ORGID column from the ORGID Only table over top the ORGID column in the Managers table and then drag the ORGID column from the ORGID Only table over the ORGID column in the LOS Data table. This will result in a model that looks like the below with a set One-To-Many relationships going from the bridge table to the Managers and LOS Data tables: To apply the RLS role to a relationship we need double click on the line that goes between the Managers table the ORGID Only table to get the Edit Relationship box to pop-up. We need to change the Cross filter direction dropdown to Both and check the Apply security filter in both directions check box: With the RLS role and relationship with security check box checked setup, the filter applied from the Manager role will filter down from the Managers table to the ORGID Only table and then finally to the LOS Data table, making so that users only see the loan data for the cost centers they have been allowed to. Assigning users - Power BI Web Service Once Row-Level Security has been configured using the Desktop application the report can be published to the Power BI Web Service and the security permissions setup on the dataset. To do this publish the report to a workspace then navigate to the dataset for that report. Hovering your mouse over the dataset will provide additional options to the right of the dataset name. Click on the three dots (...) will pop-up an options menu with the Security option: Selecting the Security options will open the Row-Level Security page, users can be added to the Role via user email address or by a user group that the user belongs to. Using our example from above if we were to add Mike, Mary, and Marge's emails to this Role, when they view this report in the Power BI Web Service they would only be able to see those cost centers that they have been assigned to through the Manager Table. Troubleshooting Power BI Desktop It can be handy to see what a user would see when the Role they are assigned to is in use. To do this in Power BI Desktop go to the Modeling Ribbon in your report that has RLS roles setup and click the View as option in the Security section: This will open the View as roles page allowing you to select the role you are wanting to test along with checking the Other user option and typing the email or domain/username of the user you would like to test as: Power BI Web Service In the Power BI Web Service you can test what a user sees by going to Row-Level Security page (were we assign users to the role), and hover over the Role name on the left and click the three docs (...) that show up to the right of the Role name. This will give an option of Test as role . Click this will open the report tied to the dataset and give you an option at the top to change who you are viewing the report as by change the Now view as: dropdown and providing a email address: Other Users The above walked through an example of using Row-Level Security through a relationship. If your data happens to contain the email that matches the user principal name in a column then you don't need to use a relationship and can assign the role directly to your data table. This can be handy if you want to give production or operation user access to a report but only want them to have access to the loans they have been assigned to. Keep in mind though that this will only work if the column in your data table that contains the email matches the user principal name when the user access the Power BI Web Service.","title":"Row-Level Security"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#row-level-security","text":"","title":"Row-Level Security"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#what-is-row-level-security-rls","text":"Row-Level Security (RLS) is a way to control access to data in a database at a row granularity. This allows users to only have access to the data that they should be authorized to see. For loan origination data, RLS helps us ensure that users only have access to the same loans they would have access to the loan origination system. An example of this is to provide managers with access to specific cost centers in reports so that they only can see loan information for their region, area, or branch only. In the example below we will walk through the steps of create a role for the manager to cost center scenario. Although we are only working through the one scenario, it could be expand on to make reports that are filtered down to originators or production team level.","title":"What is Row-Level Security (RLS)"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#important-concepts","text":"Before we dig into the how to setup and use RLS its important to understand some concepts when looking at adding it to your system: How data is refreshed in your system. If you are using DirectQuery as your data source there are a few more things that you will need to consider verses importing your data. There are few Microsoft knowledge base articles that cover this, one being the main RLS by Microsoft. All templates from this site use import and can have RLS added to if needed. Multiple Datasets or Reports. Depending on how you wish to have your data setup and users accessing that data you may end up with multiple datasets or reports that display the same information but one with RLS and another that does not. Example of this happening is if you have an executive team that needs to see all loan data in the system vs a group of managers that only need to see the subset of cost centers they manage. How will data be access. Users can access data via the Power BI Desktop or the Power BI Service. We will be using the USERPRINCIPALNAME() DAX function to identify a user and apply the correct role for them. If the user is connecting via the Power BI Web Service then you may need to consider what level of access that users has to the workspace that the data/report is stored in, please see this Microsoft KBA on using RLS with workspaces.","title":"Important Concepts"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#setting-up-rls","text":"For the below examples we are going to reference the following tables: LOS Data Table Manager Table","title":"Setting Up RLS"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#identifying-users","text":"To enable us to know what data a user should have access to via RLS we need to identify the user that is accessing the report. Luckily Power BI's DAX has a built in function that helps us with this, the USERPRINCIPALNAME() function will return a users information in the user@example.com format. We can then use that to build a access list or apply it to a set of a data to restrict users based on their User Principal Name, you can see this in our Managers data in the EMAIL column. Note Please note that there is also a USERNAME() DAX function that will return the User Principal Name when published to the Power BI Service, but when used in the Power BI Desktop version the USERNAME() returns the user information in the DOMAIN\\User format where as the USERPRINCIPALNAME() will also return the user@example.com format making a little more consistent between versions. Tip You can create a report with a blank dataset that has a set of measures, one set to USERNAME() and the other set to USERPRINCIPALNAME() . Pulling these measures out into a card visual can help see what identity you are working with and act as a troubleshooting source later when you publish the report to the Power BI Web Service.","title":"Identifying Users"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#identifying-data","text":"When applying RLS we will need to setup a filter to ensure that the user only has access to data that they are suppose to. This means the data has to have some way to group or individual identify what data a user should see. Using the USERPRINCIPALNAME() we would need a email address that is tied to the user for each row they would be given access to. Keep in mind that the email must match what is returned by the USERPRINCIPALNAME() function. In the examples below we will be using cost center to create a group that users should have access to and then use Power BI's relationships to apply the security role. In the above data set we will be building relationships off the ORGID column.","title":"Identifying Data"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#setting-up-rls-role","text":"To setup a Role that will be used for RLS first click the Manage roles button on the Model ribbon. The Model ribbon can be found while in the Report View or on the Home ribbon while in the Data or Model view. The button looks like this: Click the Mange roles button will open the Manage roles box: From here the Create button is used to create a role and then write a DAX expression that is applied to the table we want to apply RLS to. Below is a Role called Manager, that is applied to the Managers table with the a DAX statement that compares the EMAIL column in the Managers table to the USERPRINCIPALNAME() to know which roles should be accessible to the user.. Clicking the Save button will save the role. Now when a user that is assigned to this role uses the dataset, the Managers table will apply RLS and only give access to those rows where the User Principal Name equals the email found in the EMAIL column. We now need to apply the same RLS not only to the Managers table but have it also flow over to the LOS Data table. Next we look at two different way to accomplish this.","title":"Setting Up RLS Role"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#setting-up-many-to-many-relationship","text":"To create a Many-To-Many relationship go to the Model view in Power BI Desktop and drag the key column from one table to the table you wish to create the relationship with.

There are a couple of things to note on this popup: Warning about the Many-To-Many cardinality being used, make sure to take a peek at the learn more link provided and understand what this could mean for you environment. If Many-To-Many does not work check out the next example using a bridge table instead. Under the Cross filter direction, we want to make sure to check the Apply security filter in both dicrection checkbox so that the Role applied to the Managers table will filter to the LOS Data table through the relationship. Once you click OK the model view will be updated like below showing the relationship line between the two tables: With this in place when a user accesses the dataset, the Manager role filters the Managers table down to the cost centers they have access to and that in turn (because of the Apply security filter checkbox) flows down to the LOS Data, making sure that the user only sees loan data for the cost centers they have been allowed to.","title":"Setting up Many-To-Many relationship"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#setting-up-rls-using-a-bridge-table","text":"An alternative to using a Many-To-Many relationship, is to build a bridge table that contains the unique values of your key fields and then connecting the tables through this new table.

This will result in a model that looks like the below with a set One-To-Many relationships going from the bridge table to the Managers and LOS Data tables: To apply the RLS role to a relationship we need double click on the line that goes between the Managers table the ORGID Only table to get the Edit Relationship box to pop-up. We need to change the Cross filter direction dropdown to Both and check the Apply security filter in both directions check box: With the RLS role and relationship with security check box checked setup, the filter applied from the Manager role will filter down from the Managers table to the ORGID Only table and then finally to the LOS Data table, making so that users only see the loan data for the cost centers they have been allowed to.","title":"Setting up RLS using a Bridge table"},{"location":"modeling/rls/#assigning-users-power-bi-web-service","text":"Once Row-Level Security has been configured using the Desktop application the report can be published to the Power BI Web Service and the security permissions setup on the dataset.

For each page you are presented with the current volume or units for the selected range and then that same period last year. My hope is that this report is to provide much of the same data as the other pipeline report but with a focus view. Download Demo Report Dataset Before opening the template please make sure to build out the Excel worksheet or a Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) Custom View to be used as the dataset depending what template you are using. Make sure that the fields are named exactly as they are listed below in the Field Name column. If using Excel as your dataset then make sure that the sheet that has the data being used is named Data . Field Information All these fields must be part of the dataset, if one of the fields listed is not something that is currently in your LOS then it is alright to use the same data point for the column. Example, if you don't have a field for your Branch name, then it would be ok to use a field like Branch Cost Center as the Branch data. Field Name Field Description Application Date The date that a loan is considered an application Branch Field used for the name of the Branch Clear To Close The date the loan was clear to close Closer Closer's name Decisioned Date The date that the loan was decisioned Extension Amount The lock extension amount for the loan Extension Percentage The lock extension percentage amount for the loan File Started Date The date that the loan file was started GUID Unique identifier on a per loan bases Loan Number The loans loan number Loan Officer Loan Officer's name Loan Purpose The purpose of the loan such as Purchase, Refi, etc... Loan Type The type of loan such as Conventional, FHA, etc... Lock Date The date that the loan was locked Processor Processor's name Property Type The property type of the loan such as Primary, Investor, etc... Sent to Processing The date the loan was sent to processing Submitted to Underwriting The date the loan was submitted to underwriting Total Loan Amount The full loan amount Underwriter Underwriter's name These are the only required fields for the template to work correctly. If you want to expand your report to include other data points then you can add those fields in as long as they are not named the same as one of the columns above. Note This dataset uses many of the same filed as the other templates. It is possible to point the other templates at the same data source to minimize the number of reports/custom views that need to be created. Using a template Using a Excel dataset Once you have your Excel file ready to go with the correct column headers and sheet name open the template_scorecards.pbit and you will be prompted for the file path to your Excel file. This file path must be the exact full path to the file. Example is if I have my Excel file saved to my desktop as LOS_Data.xlsx then the path I would type in is C:\\Users\\Jody\\Desktop\\LOS_Data.xlsx Once the file path is typed in click load, your data will be imported and the report will open. From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Using a Microsoft SQL dataset Once you have your MSSQL custom view built out with the correct column names, open the template_current_pipeline_sql.pbit and you will be prompted for 3 pieces of information: SQL_Server: This will be the IP address or name of the SQL server that houses the database with your LOS data. SQL_DB: This is the name the database that holds the custom view we will be using for the template. Custom_View: This is the name of the custom view that contains the data needed for the template. Note If you need to add a port number to the end of your SQL server address, simply add a colon to the end of your server IP or name followed by the port number, example would be: MY-SQL-SERVER:1234, where :1234 is the port number. Once this information is loaded, you may be prompted for a user name and password for the SQL server, please work with your SQL server administrator to get the correct credentials. Once everything is connected up the report will open allowing you to customize the report to your companies needs. Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into the current pipeline for your branch and users. Pages in this report contain measures that provide insight into certain stages of the loan process. While your company may not have all these stages, it is my hope that this report can help you get started in building report that does follow your loan process by providing examples of how data is modeled and presented for use. Note Each page of this report has a Selected Range slicer that allows the user to focus on that range. Each range goes from the first of its respective time frame to today, with the exception of today which only includes data from today. Keep in mind that if you are at the beginning of a year or then it possible for the Month range to show the same numbers as the Quarter and/or Year.

Customization Options Refine Today Measures Currently all the measures that deal with the Today range all work off of just the day as today. This may cause some issues with the last year measures as there will be sometimes where today last year fell on a weekend. To get around this you could change the Today to be same business day last year. This way you are comparing no so much the actual day but the day of business instead. Today and Power BI Service Due to how the Power BI Service calculates the Today() DAX expression a custom measure found in the Measures Table\\Utility Measures folder called _correctdToday has been setup. This measure allows you to adjust the measures that display a value based on today, to match your timezone. Why this is used instead of just the Today() DAX is because of the Power BI service, when using the default is Today() it uses the local system settings of your matching running Power BI desktop to know when Today() is. If you were to publish this report the Power BI Service Today() now uses UTC time which can cause an issue where where you end up tomorrow hour before its actually tomorrow. To resolve thsi adjust #/24 part of the _correctdToday to match your current timezone which then allows both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service to display Today as expected.

Note This dataset uses many of the same filed as the other templates. It is possible to point the other templates at the same dataset to minimize the number of reports that need to be exported out of the LOS. Using the template Using Excel as a data source Once you have your Excel file ready to go with the correct column headers and sheet name open the template_disclosures.pbit and you will be prompted for the file path to your Excel file. This file path must be the exact full path to the file. Example is if I have my Excel file saved to my desktop as LOS_Data.xlsx then the path I would type in is C:\\Users\\Jody\\Desktop\\LOS_Data.xlsx Once the file path is typed in click load, your data will be imported and the report will open. From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Using Microsoft SQL as a data source Once you have your MSSQL custom view built out with the correct column names, open the template_disclosure_sql.pbit and you will be prompted for 3 pieces of information: SQL_Server: This can be the IP address or name of the SQL server that the database that house your data resides. SQL_DB: This is the name of the database that holds the custom view we are wanting to use for the template. Custom_View: This is the name of the custom view that contains the columns needed for the template. Note If you need to add a port number to the end of your SQL server address simply add a colon to the end followed by the port number, example MY-SQL-SERVER:1234. Once this information is loaded, you may be prompted for a username and password for the SQL server, please work with your server admin to get the correct credentials. Once everything is connected up the report will open allowing you to customize the report to your companies needs. Report Page This is a single page report that delivers information about how many disclosures that have a due date of today, tomorrow, and then two or more days out. The report page is split in two with the left side acting as a slicer panel letting you choose a branch to focus on, which disclosure type you would like to see. You may only select one disclosure type at time otherwise the report will default to Closing. There is also a slicer for due in, allowing you to focus on a set of disclosures and filtering out those that may not be as high priority. The right side of the report displays the data based on what slicers are set. The cards at the top provide a color coded total amount of disclosures due in their respective time frames. The bar graph breaks down total number of disclosures due based on how long they are due in by branch. You can drill into each branch to a loan officer level by using the drill down arrow found in the header of the visual or drill down to all loan officers by using the go to next level arrows (double set of down arrows next to the drill down arrow). The table visual provides loan level information along with a color status to the left of the loan number to indicate its current due in status. Customization Changing Colors If you would like to change the colors that represent the number of days due in, you do so by doing the following for each visual: Cards: Under the Format Visual window choose Cards and then \"Apply setting to\" and choose the card you would like to edit. Once selected choose the Fill option and change the color using the color picker. You will need to change the \"Apply setting to\" select for each card. Bar Graph: Under the Format Visual window choose the Bars option and set the color based on what you would like. Table: To change the status color that appears edit the Dynamic Due Measures Color Switch measure found under Measures Table -> Formatting -> Dynamic. You will need the hex code for the color you would like to use. Tip If you have previously selected a color using the color picker then you can hover over that color in the color picker window to get the colors hex code. For constancy it would be best to set all visuals to have the same color code.

Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide forecast based on previous years of data from your LOS platform. Each report page contains the same visuals and slicers to filter the data. As such we initial focus on the following areas for forecast but feel free to add more or remove pages that do not match your companies needs: File Started Applications Locks Funded Since each page contains the same visuals lets take a closer look at each one and see what information it provides or how it interacts with the report. Slicers Year The Year slicer provides the current year and the next year as selections. This slicer uses the Year column from the Dates table as its source while having the Date Range - Filter column applied as the filter for this visual. The Date Range - Filter will make sure that the 2 years (current and next year) are always shown. Note If you have next year chosen but only choose 1 year in the Historical Years slicer, you will only have a forecast up to the current month. This is expected as we are only looking 1 year back for historical data to use and have not gotten past the past the current month in the current year which would be one year back from next year. Units/Volume Like many of the report templates found on this site the Units/Volume slicer allows you to toggle between viewing the data in total loans (Units) or the total loan amount (Volume). Choosing one of those options will update the visuals to show the corresponding data, as well as updating titles to match. Loan Type Allows you to focus the report down to the different loan types that may be in your system. Loan Purpose Like Loan Type this slicer allows for a focus look at loan purpose that may be available in your system. Growth Factor This slicer impacts the forecast measure directly. The way we calculate the forecast is to get the average for the loan data based on the years selected and then multiply that by the growth factor selected. This allows us to quickly adjust our forecast based on how the year is going or allow report consumers to do multiple forecast across many different growth scenarios without the need to edit the underlying DAX. Historical Years This slicer also impacts the forecast measure directly. We use this number to know how many previous years to average for the forecast measure. Branch Allows a focus on the forecast for a particular Branch or multiple branches can be selected to make up an Area/Region. Note When choosing branches, if a branch does not have a full set of historical data based on the number of years chosen then only those months that have historical data will show a value. Totals This visual shows the total units or volume, depending on what is selected, based on the current filters on the left side of the page. By default this shows the full years total but clicking or control clicking on the months on the line graph these totals can be filtered further down. This is helpful to narrow down the totals to a selected month or quarter of the year. The Current total shows all loans for the selected page up to the last sync time of the data. While the Forecast total show the forecasted total for the selected page based on the growth factor and historical years chosen. Line Graph The line graph section of the report actually is composed of 3 main visuals, a line graph to display both the Forecast and Current data based on the filters chosen and then two slicers to change how the data is represented on the line graph. The Show As slicer provides a way to change how the totals are displayed. When Cumulative is selected then the line graph will show a Year to Date representation of the data, allowing us to see how the year should progress. When Monthly is chosen the line graph will change into a more month over month representation, allowing for a look at how the current year is stacking up against the forecast. The Historical Data slicer give a way to show or hide the forecast for months that have passed. When Historical Data is hidden then we display the current (actuals) for the months that we have full data for, example being if we are in October, I will only show current up to September. This is because we don't know what the current totals are going to end at for the current month and we only show the forecast for the months that we do not have full currents for. When we show Historical Data we are actually showing the forecast for all months along with the currents for those months. With this selection the currents for the current month are shown as we know that that is and compare it to the forecast for this month. Note When choosing to show the Cumulative data with the Historical Data shown the current data will plateau out in the current month. This is to be expected as we only have data up to the current month and the rest of the year has not happened yet.

Download Demo Report Dataset Before opening the template please make sure to build out the Excel worksheet or a Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) Custom View to be used as the dataset depending what template you are using. Make sure that the fields are named exactly as they are listed below in the Field Name column. If using Excel as your dataset then make sure that the sheet that has the data being used is named Data . Field Information All these fields must be part of the dataset, if one of the fields listed is not something that is currently in your LOS then it is alright to use the same data point for the column.

LTV The loan to value of the loan Loan Officer Loan Officer's name Processor Processor's name Underwriter Underwriter's name Closer Closer's name Current Milestone Field used to hold the current milestone value of the loan These are the only required fields for the template to work correctly. If you want to expand your report to include other data points then you can add those fields in as long as they are not named the same as one of the columns above. Note This dataset can be used with the template_projection.pbit as well. It is possible to point the funding and projection report at the same dataset to minimize the number of reports that need to be exported out of the LOS. Using a template Using a Excel dataset Once you have your Excel file ready to go with the correct column headers and sheet name open the template_funding.pbit and you will be prompted for the file path to your Excel file. This file path must be the exact full path to the file. Example is if I have my Excel file saved to my desktop as LOS_Data.xlsx then the path I would type in is C:\\Users\\Jody\\Desktop\\LOS_Data.xlsx Once the file path is typed in click load, your data will be imported and the report will open. From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Using a Microsoft SQL dataset Once you have your MSSQL custom view built out with the correct column names, open the template_funding_sql.pbit and you will be prompted for 3 pieces of information: SQL_Server: This will be the IP address or name of the SQL server that houses the database with your LOS data. SQL_DB: This is the name the database that holds the custom view we will be using for the template. Custom_View: This is the name of the custom view that contains the data needed for the template. Note If you need to add a port number to the end of your SQL server address, simply add a colon to the end of your server IP or name followed by the port number, example would be: MY-SQL-SERVER:1234, where :1234 is the port number. Once this information is loaded, you may be prompted for a user name and password for the SQL server, please work with your SQL server administrator to get the correct credentials. Once everything is connected up the report will open allowing you to customize the report to your companies needs. Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into loans that have funded in the time range selected. Pages in this report are intended to provide break downs based on funded units and volume for origination and operations, along with providing a high level average statistics of funded loans. Branch Page This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a branch is doing. Selecting a branch from the By Branch line graph will filter the rest of the visual on the page to show how much that particular branch contributed to the whole. While you have a branch selected the Drill to Details button will become available, this will allow a user to drill to the Branch Details page which provides many of the same visual just focused on that Branch. Operations Page This page provide insight of how operations preformed based on funded loans. Clicking on one of the users in a line chart will filter the page down to show who that user mostly worked with and what type of loans that user worked on during that date range. Operation v2 Page This page is optional to use, it provides similar visuals as the Operations page but allows you to focus on a particular operation role instead of having all the data for all roles on the same page. Caution This page may not work very well in larger datasets as the number of users in each role may cause a larger dataset and cause the report to load slowly. Branch Details Page This page is a drill down page from the Branch page. Drilling to this page will provide funding information for the branch selected as part of the drill down. This provides information for Loan Officers found in that branch. Funding Stats Page This page has average characteristics for funded loans in the date range selected. A chart showing Selected Year vs Previous year for Units and Volume. Finally a Year to Date line graph provides insight of funded loans over the last 5 years. Customization Options Projection Date In the LOS_Data table a custom column with the name of Projection Date is used to determine when a loan is projected to close. By default that column calculates the max of the Est Closing Date or the Disbursement Date fields for the loan. If your company uses some other field or calculation to project when a loan will close, updating this custom column will bring the report closer to your companies work flow. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to only show dates in the last five years. A custom column in the Dates table with the name of Date Range - 5 Years is used for this filter. By changing the DAX in this field you can narrow or expand the that date range. Info Most the time when updating a columns name in Power BI, visuals and filters that use that column will automatically update. If for some reason it doesn't simple remove the old column from the Filters pane and replace with your new column.

Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into the current and historical pipeline for your branch and users. Pages in this report contain measures that provide insight into certain stages of the loan process. While your company may not have all these stages, it is my hope that this report can help you get started in building report that does follow your loan process by providing examples of how data is modeled and presented for use. Started This page is designed to provide information on files that have Start date in the date range selected.

From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Using a Microsoft SQL dataset Once you have your MSSQL custom view built out with the correct column names, open the template_projection_sql.pbit and you will be prompted for 3 pieces of information: SQL_Server: This will be the IP address or name of the SQL server that houses the database with your LOS data. SQL_DB: This is the name the database that holds the custom view we will be using for the template. Custom_View: This is the name of the custom view that contains the data needed for the template. Note If you need to add a port number to the end of your SQL server address, simply add a colon to the end of your server IP or name followed by the port number, example would be: MY-SQL-SERVER:1234, where :1234 is the port number. Once this information is loaded, you may be prompted for a user name and password for the SQL server, please work with your SQL server administrator to get the correct credentials. Once everything is connected up the report will open allowing you to customize the report to your companies needs. Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into loans that are projected to close in the time range selected. Pages in this report are intended to provide break downs based on projected units and volume for origination and operations. Branch Page This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a branch is doing. Selecting a branch from the By Branch line graph will filter the rest of the visual on the page to show how much that particular branch contributed to the whole. While you have a branch selected the Drill to Details button will become available, this will allow a user to drill to the Branch Details page which provides many of the same visual just focused on that Branch. Operations Page This page provide insight of how operations preformed based on projected loans. Clicking on one of the users in a line chart will filter the page down to show who that user will mostly be working with and what type of loans that user will be working on during that date range. Operation v2 Page This page is optional to use, it provides similar visuals as the Operations page but allows you to focus on a particular operation role instead of having all the data for all roles on the same page. Caution This page may not work very well in larger datasets as the number of users in each role may cause a larger dataset and cause the report to load slowly. Branch Details Page This page is a drill down page from the Branch page. Drilling to this page will provide projection information for the branch selected as part of the drill down. This provides information for Loan Officers found in that branch. Customization Options Projection Date In the LOS_Data table a custom column with the name of Projection Date is used to determine when a loan is projected to close. By default that column calculates the max of the Est Closing Date or the Disbursement Date fields for the loan. If your company uses some other field or calculation to project when a loan will close, updating this custom column will bring the report closer to your companies work flow. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to show dates in the last three years and two year in the future. A custom column in the Dates table with the name of Date Range - 3 Past Years and 2 Forward is used for this filter. By changing the DAX in this field you can narrow or expand the that date range. Info Most the time when updating a columns name in Power BI, visuals and filters that use that column will automatically update. If for some reason it doesn't simple remove the old column from the Filters pane and replace with your new column.

Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into branch and users performance. Pagens in this report are intended to provided break downs based on loan milestone dates, along with providing a comparison of company averages. Branch Scorecard This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a Branch is doing. All visuals on the page but for the Funded vs Started line/bar visual, are filtered by the slicers found on the left side of the report page. The Funded vs Started line/bar visual is not affected by the Date Range slicer and will always show a rolling 12 month to date range. The total funded units and volume can be found next to the company averages by Branch. The average days measures are based on calendar weekdays. Loan Officer Scorecard This page provides information broken down on a individual Loan Officer level. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a Loan Officer is doing. All visuals on the page but for the Funded vs Started line/bar visual, are filtered by the slicers found on the left side of the report page.

The total units Sent to Closing and Funded can be found next to the company averages by Closer. The average days measures are based on calendar weekdays. Customization Options Business Days All the Milestone Date Durations columns in the LOS_Data table are based on the DAX function NETWORKDAYS . It may be more accurate to update these custom columns to exclude federal and company holidays. To do this you will need to add a holiday table to the data model and update the NETWORKDAYS part of the custom column like below: Durration - Milestone 1 to Milestone 2 = VAR _milestoneOneDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 1 Date ] VAR _milestoneTwoDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 2 Date ] VAR _duration = IF ( AND ( _milestoneOneDate , _miestoneTwoDate ), NETWORKDAYS ( _milestoneOneDate , _milestoneTwoDate , 1 , holiday_table ) - 1 , BLANK ()) RETURN IF ( _duration < 0 , BLANK (), _duration ) If you are not using the using a version of Power BI Destkop that supports the NETWORKDAYS function then you can subtitube the code in the duration columsn with the below. To use this you will need to setup a date table with the Is Weekday custom field: Durration - Milestone 1 to Milestone 2 = VAR _milestoneOneDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 1 Date ] VAR _milestoneTwoDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 2 Date ] VAR _duration = If ( AND ( _milestoneOneDate , _milestoneTwoDate ), CALCULATE ( SUM ( Dates [ Is Weekday ]), DATESBETWEEN ( Dates [ Date ], _milestoneOneDate , _milestoneTwoDate )) - 1 , BLANK ()) RETURN If ( _duration < 0 , BLANK (), _duration ) If you plan on using the above DAX but need to also need to exclude federal and company holidays please contact me. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to only show dates in the last five years. A custom column in the Dates table with the name of Date Range - Scorecard is used for this filter. By changing the DAX in this field you can narrow or expand the that date range. Info Most the time when updating a columns name in Power BI, visuals and filters that use that column will automatically update.
