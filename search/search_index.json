I wanted create and easy to setup and use program that would create a Excel, with a few changes to some configuration files this application will create an Excel file with Encompass data ready to be used in any report. Note Always make sure to review and test any application you download before using in a production environment. BitBucket links for source code for this application will be provided later in this write up. Source Code and Downloads Source Code A ReadMe file with full dependencies can be found using the below BitBucket link below: Source on BitBucket To download a zip copy of the source code to review or compile please use the link below: Download from BitBucket Setup Make sure that you compile a copy of this application before trying to run it as there are configuration files that must be edited before the application will work properly. Dependencies To compile a copy of this application you will need a computer that is running the Encompass SDK. Included in the download folder is a \"support dlls\" folder which contains the ConfigManger dll that is used to encrypt the appSettings part of the application config file, so that no username or passwords a stored in plain text. For the other dependencies that are not Encompass or ConfigManger please use Nuget Manager to download the rest of the packages needed to compile. Note Links for each Nuget package can be found in the ReadMe file located on BitBucket using the link above. Configuration Files Once the application is compiled there are two configuration files that must be edit before it will work properly. The Simple_Report_Export.exe.Config file (you may need to show file extension on your computer to find this file) has the appSettings and OutputSettings sections which are used to tell the application information it will need to generate the report. The report_settings.json file provides the fields from Encompass to pull as part of the data, along with the information on how build the report criteria. Simple_Report_Export.exe.Config This file contains important information needed for the application to login to Encompass, as well settings for where to output the generating the excel file. Example of what this file will look like is: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name= \"OutputSettings\" type= \"System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler\" /> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version= \"v4.0\" sku= \".NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2\" /> </startup> <runtime> <NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy enabled= \"true\" /> </runtime> <appSettings> <add key= \"encServer\" value= \"https://BE123456.ea.elliemae.net/Encompass$BE123456\" /> <add key= \"encUsername\" value= \"Encompass Username\" /> <add key= \"encPassword\" value= \"Encaompss Password\" /> </appSettings> <OutputSettings> <add key= \"Path\" value = \"C:\\Report_Data\\\" /> <add key= \"FileName\" value = \"LOS_Data.xlsx\" /> </OutputSettings> </configuration> appSettings This section of the configuration file handles who and where this application will log into. On first run the application will encrypt this section of the configuration file so that no the Encompass information used to create an Encompass session is saved as plain text. Note When first running the application it may appear as if the application didn't do anything, this is when the encryption is happening. Running the application again with a encrypted configuration file will result in the application running completely if all other setting are correct. OutputSettings This section of the configuration file handles where and what the exported Excel file will be. The Path is the full folder path to where the Excel file should be saved. You must include the tailing \"\\\" to make sure that the correct folder is used. The FileName path is what the Excel file will be called on export. The \".xlsx\" extension must included for the file to save correctly. report_settings.json This file contains the information needed on what fields to use when pulling data from Encompass, along with information on how to build the report criteria. The two section in this file are the Fields section and the QuerySettings section. Fields Section The fields json object allows you to provide a description which will be used later as the column title in Excel, along with the ID of the field in Encompass that you wish to pull into your report. Example of the Fields section is: { \"Fields\" : [ { \"ID\" : \"364\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Number\" }, { \"ID\" : \"2\" , \"Desc\" : \"Total Loan Amount\" }, { \"ID\" : \"GUID\" , \"Desc\" : \"GUID\" }, { \"ID\" : \"LOANFOLDER\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Folder\" } ] } Note Please note that any fields you use must be part of the Encompass Reporting Data Base for the Excel file to generate. Tip The default description in the report_settings.json that is available on BitBucket match the ones needed for the Power BI templates on this site. Once you have updated the ID field to what makes sense from your system, the exported file will work for all current templates. QuerySettings Section Settings in this section define what query criterion will be used when the Excel document is generated. There are two properties that must be in this section, those being the StartDate and the ExcludedFolders. The StartDate can be a empty string (to use an empty string please input \"\" for the value of StartDate), if you with so pull all loans from the loan origination system. When the StartDate property is set (must be in the format \"01/01/2018\") all loans with a File Started Milestone date on or after that date will be pulled into the Excel file. Tip Limiting the amount of data pulled into this Excel fill will make the export happen quicker. This will also limit the data you have to work with in Power Bi when imported, make sure to set the StartDate to a comfortable number years that works for what your reporting needs are. The ExcludedFolders list must have at least have one folder listed in it. Loans in the folders listed will not be pulled into the Excel file. And example of the QuerySettings section is: \"QuerySettings\" : { \"StartDate\" : \"01/01/2018\" , \"ExcludedFolders\" : [ \"(Trash)\" , \"Testing Training\" , \"(Archive)\" ] } Tip Not all data in Encompass is useful in reports and it is easier just to not pull in that data instead of trying to model around it in Power BI. If you have a Testing and Training folder, it is a pretty good bet that loans in that folder will not be needed for reports and is safe to exclude from being exported to Excel. Example report_settings.json Below is a example of a full report_settings.json file: { \"Fields\" : [ { \"ID\" : \"GUID\" , \"Desc\" : \"GUID\" }, { \"ID\" : \"364\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Number\" }, { \"ID\" : \"LOANFOLDER\" , \"Desc\" : \"Loan Folder\" } ], \"QuerySettings\" : { \"StartDate\" : \"01/01/2018\" , \"ExcludedFolders\" : [ \"(Trash)\" , \"Testing_Training\" , \"(Archive)\" ] } } First Run Once the application has been compiled and the configuration files have been updated, double clicking on the Simple_Report.Export.exe. On first run it will encrypt the appSettings section of the Simple_Report_Export.exe.Config file. Any run after that will use the encrypted appSettings to create a connection with Encompass and try and generate an Excel file with the fields proved based on the criteria in the report_settings.json file. Troubleshooting In the same directory as where the Simple_Report_Export.exe application is, a simple_report_export.log file will be generated. This log file will include information each time the application is run allow for you to see if any errors occurred and troubleshoot as needed.

Thank you!","title":"Need Help"},{"location":"datasources/users/","text":"User Data Source Reason As your data grows or you start to pull in more data spanning more time you may run into a problem as shown in the screenshot below, where you have a user that has changed their name. What happens in Power BI is that because these are unique data points, it reflects that way in the visual creating, in this case, both a Jane A Doe and a Jane Doe bar in the graph: What this can cause is a skew when a users looks at the report, thinking that Jane only worked on 17 funded loans where in reality she actually worked on 29. Worse would be if users start questioning if the data is reliable. Luckily there are a couple of ways that this can be resolved. Users Table Before we can get into the actually ways to resolve this we are going to need to gather some data to help resolve the problem. What we are needing is a users table. This table will usually have one or multiple unique identification column, this could be a username or employee id, really anything that is unique to the user themselves. The table will also have the full name or the display name of the user. The goal of this is to have a table of data with users names we would like to display in a report that have a data point that is unique to that user. A good example of this would be getting a table of loan officers names with their corresponding NMLS number. Since the NMLS number is unique to an loan office, we now have a way to identify a user in a dataset based on that instead of using the loan officers name from the loan origination system (LOS) data. Resolutions The resolutions listed below are only a couple of ways that this can resolved. In an ideal world you would have your user table available with your LOS data and could create a dataset where the names are already set from the data source server. In most cases I have not found this possible, which is why I have had to use the resolutions below for different datasets. Relationships Once we have gotten our users with unique ids setup in a users table, we are ready to start working on solving for the same user showing up multiple times in our visuals. The easiest way to accomplish this, especially when you are only dealing with on set of users, is using relationships in Power BI. Relationships allows us to use the unique id for the user found in both the LOS data and on our users table to use the full name from the users table in visuals with data from our LOS. To setup you a relationship, once you have your LOS data and User table loaded, head over to the Model tab in Power BI desktop: Once that is open you will presented with a list your data sources, in this example I have a simple set of LOS data and a user table I created. Notice in both tables I have a UserID column. In the LOS_Data this column contains the unique id for the user that worked on a loan. In the User_Table the UserID column contains the unique ID mapped to the FullName of the user, so that I can use this name in my report visuals. To create the relationship simple drag the UserID from the users table to the UserID in th LOS data, Power Bi will do the rest and create the 1 to many relationship: Once create we can use the FullName field from the Users_Table when we need to display user names in a visual and it will be used instead of what is in the LOS data. Using the earlier example with Jane we are now able to create a bar graph that has all Jane's funded loan showing as her instead of being split between the two names that are in the LOS data: Lookup Column In some case you either have multiple users you need to replace in a visual (such as a matrix or table visual), or you have multiple visual on a page that has multiple user roles on it (such as the Funding Report's operations page). In this case using one user table will not work as you cannot have multiple relationships between the same tables. While you could have multiple user tables this could end up being a maintenance and resource nightmare. A simpler solution would be just to use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function to return the value from your users table. To do this we would create a custom column (click here if you need help creating a custom column) and then add the following code into the formula bar: User_Lookup = //Create a variable to store the looked up user, setting to blank if nothing is found VAR _userLookup = LOOKUPVALUE ( Users_Table [ FullName ], Users_Table [ UserID ], LOS_Data [ UserID ], BLANK ()) //If the user lookup is blank set this column to the LOS user name, else use the looked up full name RETURN IF ( ISBLANK ( _userLookup ), LOS_Data [ User ], _userLookup ) That is it, now you have a a column full of user names from the user table that can be used in visuals. The nice thing about this lookup is that if for some reason a user is not found int he user table then it will just default back to what is in the LOS data. This can be helpful if your LOS data sync regularly but the user table isn't updated as frequently. Conclusion Using a user table is a great way to make sure report is accurate and reliable for your end users. The relationship and lookup way of getting users are just a couple of ways I have used in the past to make sure my data is in a good state. There are many different ways that this could be accomplished but hopefully these two will help you in your data exploration.","title":"Users"},{"location":"datasources/users/#user-data-source","text":"","title":"User Data Source"},{"location":"datasources/users/#reason","text":"As your data grows or you start to pull in more data spanning more time you may run into a problem as shown in the screenshot below, where you have a user that has changed their name.

The goal of this is to have a table of data with users names we would like to display in a report that have a data point that is unique to that user. A good example of this would be getting a table of loan officers names with their corresponding NMLS number. Since the NMLS number is unique to an loan office, we now have a way to identify a user in a dataset based on that instead of using the loan officers name from the loan origination system (LOS) data.","title":"Users Table"},{"location":"datasources/users/#resolutions","text":"The resolutions listed below are only a couple of ways that this can resolved. In an ideal world you would have your user table available with your LOS data and could create a dataset where the names are already set from the data source server. In most cases I have not found this possible, which is why I have had to use the resolutions below for different datasets.","title":"Resolutions"},{"location":"datasources/users/#relationships","text":"Once we have gotten our users with unique ids setup in a users table, we are ready to start working on solving for the same user showing up multiple times in our visuals. The easiest way to accomplish this, especially when you are only dealing with on set of users, is using relationships in Power BI. Relationships allows us to use the unique id for the user found in both the LOS data and on our users table to use the full name from the users table in visuals with data from our LOS. To setup you a relationship, once you have your LOS data and User table loaded, head over to the Model tab in Power BI desktop: Once that is open you will presented with a list your data sources, in this example I have a simple set of LOS data and a user table I created. Notice in both tables I have a UserID column. In the LOS_Data this column contains the unique id for the user that worked on a loan. In the User_Table the UserID column contains the unique ID mapped to the FullName of the user, so that I can use this name in my report visuals. To create the relationship simple drag the UserID from the users table to the UserID in th LOS data, Power Bi will do the rest and create the 1 to many relationship: Once create we can use the FullName field from the Users_Table when we need to display user names in a visual and it will be used instead of what is in the LOS data. Using the earlier example with Jane we are now able to create a bar graph that has all Jane's funded loan showing as her instead of being split between the two names that are in the LOS data:","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"datasources/users/#lookup-column","text":"In some case you either have multiple users you need to replace in a visual (such as a matrix or table visual), or you have multiple visual on a page that has multiple user roles on it (such as the Funding Report's operations page). In this case using one user table will not work as you cannot have multiple relationships between the same tables. While you could have multiple user tables this could end up being a maintenance and resource nightmare. A simpler solution would be just to use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function to return the value from your users table. To do this we would create a custom column (click here if you need help creating a custom column) and then add the following code into the formula bar: User_Lookup = //Create a variable to store the looked up user, setting to blank if nothing is found VAR _userLookup = LOOKUPVALUE ( Users_Table [ FullName ], Users_Table [ UserID ], LOS_Data [ UserID ], BLANK ()) //If the user lookup is blank set this column to the LOS user name, else use the looked up full name RETURN IF ( ISBLANK ( _userLookup ), LOS_Data [ User ], _userLookup ) That is it, now you have a a column full of user names from the user table that can be used in visuals. The nice thing about this lookup is that if for some reason a user is not found int he user table then it will just default back to what is in the LOS data. This can be helpful if your LOS data sync regularly but the user table isn't updated as frequently.","title":"Lookup Column"},{"location":"datasources/users/#conclusion","text":"Using a user table is a great way to make sure report is accurate and reliable for your end users. The relationship and lookup way of getting users are just a couple of ways I have used in the past to make sure my data is in a good state.

Althoguh your data may have dates in it, it is likely that those dates have gaps in them for weekends or holidays, an independent date table allows for DAX time intelligence functions to work properly and create accurate results. Creating a Date Table One of the easiest ways to create a date table, if you don't have one already built out, is to create a table inside of Power BI using DAX. To do this, in Power BI Desktop click on the Modeling Tab and select New table: This will open up the table formula bar: You can either create your own date table using DAX or use the code below as a started for your table. This code will create a table full of dates between the start and end dates. It will also format that date in different ways that can be used in different measures: Dates = //Make sure to start as January 1st of a year VAR _startDate = DATE ( 2013 , 1 , 1 ) //Make sure to end on December 31st of a year VAR _endDate = DATE ( 2022 , 12 , 31 ) RETURN ADDCOLUMNS ( CALENDAR ( _startDate , _endDate ), \"DateAsInteger\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYYMMDD\" ), \"YEAR\" , YEAR ([ Date ]), \"MonthNumber\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"MM\" ), \"YearMonthNumber\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY/MM\" ), \"YearMonthShort\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY/mmm\" ), \"MonthNameShort\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"mmm\" ), \"MonthNameLong\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"mmmm\" ), \"DayOfWeekNumber\" , WEEKDAY ([ Date ]), \"DayOfWeek\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"dddd\" ), \"DayOfWeekShort\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"ddd\" ), \"WeekNum\" , WEEKNUM ([ Date ]), \"WeekNumYear\" , WEEKNUM ([ Date ]) & \"-\" & FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY\" ), \"Quarter\" , \"Q\" & FORMAT ([ Date ], \"Q\" ), \"YearQuarter\" , FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY\" ) & \"/Q\" & FORMAT ([ Date ], \"Q\" ) ) The final step to setting up a date table is setting the table as the default Date Table so that Power BI uses it for DAX time intellegence measures. To do this locate the Dates table created in the steps above in the Fields list on the right hand side of Power BI desktop. Right click on the table created and select the \"Mark as date table\" option: This will pop up the Mark as date table prompt. From the Date column drop down select the Date column from the table an click OK: That's it, you have not setup a date table and told Power BI to use for time intellegence measures for DAX. Additional Custom Columns It may be handy to expand your date table out to provide additional filtering or functionality, the below are some additional custom columns I have found useful to add to this table over the years, please feel free to add any as needed in your project. How to create a Custom Column To create a custom column in a table first select the table you wish to add the custom column to. Next in the Modeling tab at the top of Powe BI select New column: This will open up the column formula bar, in which you can type in your DAX to create a new custom column: Please feel free to use any of the custom columns below as needed in your project. Custom Columns After Today This custom column can be used when you want to filter a visual or slicer down to only show dates that are after today. A modification that can be made to this is instead of just the greater then symbol (>), you could replace it with the greater than or equal to symbols (>=) to include todays date in the column: After Today = IF ( Dates [ Date ] > TODAY (), TRUE (), FALSE ()) Before Today Similar to the After Today this custom colum can be used when you want to filter a visual or slicer down to only show dates before today. A modification that can be made to this is instead of just the lesser then symbol (<), you could replace it with the lesser than or equal to symbols (<=) to include todays date in the column: Before Today = IF ( Dates [ Date ] < TODAY (), TRUE (), FALSE ()) Current Week This custom field can be used when you need to either know you are in the current week for a measure or when you need to restrict a measure down to a the current week: Current Week = var _thisWeekNum = WEEKNUM ( TODAY ()) var _thisYear = YEAR ( TODAY ()) var _currentWeekNumYear = _thisWeekNum & \"-\" & _thisYear RETURN IF ( _currentWeekNumYear = Dates [ WeekNumYear ], TRUE (), FALSE ()) In or Before Current Year This custom field can be used when you want to filter a visual or slicer down to only show a date range for this year and the years before in the date table: In or Before Current Year = IF ( Dates [ YEAR ] <= YEAR ( TODAY ()), TRUE (), FALSE ()) In or After Current Month This custom field can be used when you want to filter a visual or slicer to only show a date range for this month and after in the date table: In or After Current Month = IF ( Dates [ YearMonthNumber ] >= FORMAT ( TODAY (), \"YYYY/MM\" ), TRUE (), FALSE ()) In or Before Current Month Similar to the In or After Current Month , this custom field can be used when you wan tto filter a visual or slicer to only show a date range for this month or before in the date table: In or Before Current Month = IF ( FORMAT ([ Date ], \"YYYY/MM\" ) <= FORMAT ( TODAY (), \"YYYY/MM\" ), TRUE (), FALSE ()) Is Weekday This function is helpful when you are needing to count number of weekdays between two dates.

Customization Options Refine Today Measures Currently all the measures that deal with the Today range all work off of just the day as today. This may cause some issues with the last year measures as there will be sometimes where today last year fell on a weekend. To get around this you could change the Today to be same business day last year. This way you are comparing no so much the acutal day but the day of business instead. Today and Power BI Servcie Due to how the Power BI Service calculates the Today() DAX expression a custom measure found in the Measures Table\\Utility Measures folder called _correctdToday has been setup. This measure allows you to adjust the measures that display a value based on today, to match your timezone. Why this is used instead of just the Today() DAX is because of the Power BI service, when using the default is Today() it uses the local system settings of your maching running Power BI desktop to know when Today() is. If you were to publish this report the Power BI Service Today() now uses UTC time which can cause an issue where where you end up tomorrow hour before its actually tomorrow. To resolve thsi adjust #/24 part of the _correctdToday to match your current timezone which then allows both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service to display Today as expected.

My hope is that this report will act as a starting point to build out a Funding report that works best for your companies work flow. Download Demo Report Dataset Before opening the template please make sure to build out the Excel worksheet used as the Dataset for this template. Make sure that the fields are named exactly as they are listed below in the Field Name column and the sheet name in Excel is named Data . Field Information All these fields must be part of the dataset, if one of the fields listed is not something that is currently in your LOS then it is alright to use the same data point for the column. Example, if you don't have a field for your Branch name, then it would be ok to reuse the same field this is used for ORGID as the Branch data. Field Name Field Description ORGID Field used to group loans based on branch number or Cost Center Branch Field used for the name of the Branch GUID Unique identifier on a per loan bases Disbursement Date Date whcih a Loan proceeds are Funded by Lender Top Ratio Front end DTI for the loan Bottom Ratio Back end DTI for the loan Est Closing Date Estimated Date the loan will close FICO The FICO score from the loan Total Loan Amount The full loan amount Funding Date The date the loan was funded Interest Rate The interest rate of the loan Loan Number The loans loan number Loan Purpose The purpose of the loan such as Purchase, Refi, etc... Loan Type The type of loan such as Conventional, FHA, etc... LTV The loan to value of the loan Loan Officer Loan Officer's name Processor Processor's name Underwriter Underwriter's name Closer Closer's name Current Milestone Field used to hold the current milestone value of the loan These are the only required fields for the template to work correctly. If you want to expand your report to include other data points then you can add those fields in as long as they are not named the same as one of the columns above. Note This dataset can be used with the template_projection.pbit as well. It is possible to point the funding and projection report at the same dataset to minimize the number of reports that need to be exported out of the LOS. Using the template Once you have your Excel file ready to go with the correct column headers and sheet name open the template_funding.pbit and you will be prompted for the file path to your Excel file. This file path must be the exact full path to the file. Example is if I have my Excel file saved to my desktop as LOS_Data.xlsx then the path I would type in is C:\\Users\\Jody\\Desktop\\LOS_Data.xlsx Once the file path is typed in click load, your data will be imported and the report will open. From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into loans that have funded in the time range selected. Pages in this report are intended to provide break downs based on funded units and volume for origination and operations, along with providing a high level average statistics of funded loans. Branch Page This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a branch is doing. Selecting a branch from the By Branch line graph will filter the rest of the visual on the page to show how much that particular branch contributed to the whole. While you have a branch selected the Drill to Details button will become available, this will allow a user to drill to the Branch Details page which provides many of the same visual just focused on that Branch. Operations Page This page provide insight of how operations preformed based on funded loans. Clicking on one of the users in a line chart will filter the page down to show who that user mostly worked with and what type of loans that user worked on during that date range. Operation v2 Page This page is optional to use, it provides similar visuals as the Operations page but allows you to focus on a particular operation role instead of having all the data for all roles on the same page. Caution This page may not work very well in larger datasets as the number of users in each role may cause a larger dataset and cause the report to load slowly. Branch Details Page This page is a drill down page from the Branch page. Drilling to this page will provide funding information for the branch selected as part of the drill down. This provides information for Loan Officers found in that branch. Funding Stats Page This page has average characteristics for funded loans in the date range selected. A chart showing Selected Year vs Previous year for Units and Volume. Finally a Year to Date line graph provides insight of funded loans over the last 5 years. Customization Options Projection Date In the LOS_Data table a custom column with the name of Projection Date is used to determine when a loan is projected to close. By default that column calculates the max of the Est Closing Date or the Disbursement Date fields for the loan. If your company uses some other field or calculation to project when a loan will close, updating this custom column will bring the report closer to your companies work flow. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to only show dates in the last five years. A custom column in the Dates table with the name of Date Range - 5 Years is used for this filter. By changing the DAX in this field you can narrow or expand the that date range. Info Most the time when updating a columns name in Power BI, visuals and filters that use that column will automatically update.

My hope is that this report will act as a starting point to build out a Projections report that works best for your companies work flow. Download Report Demo Dataset Before opening the template please make sure to build out the Excel worksheet used as the Dataset for this template. Make sure that the fields are named exactly as they are listed below in the Field Name column and the sheet name in Excel is named Data . Field Information All these fields must be part of the dataset, if one of the fields listed is not something that is currently in your LOS then it is alright to use the same data point for the column. Example, if you don't have a field for your Branch name, then it would be ok to reuse the same field this is used for ORGID as the Branch data. Field Name Field Description ORGID Field used to group loans based on branch number or Cost Center Branch Field used for the name of the Branch GUID Unique identifier on a per loan bases Disbursement Date Date which a Loan proceeds are Funded by Lender Top Ratio Front end DTI for the loan Bottom Ratio Back end DTI for the loan Est Closing Date Estimated Date the loan will close FICO The FICO score from the loan Total Loan Amount The full loan amount Funding Date The date the loan was funded Interest Rate The interest rate of the loan Loan Number The loans loan number Loan Purpose The purpose of the loan such as Purchase, Refi, etc... Loan Type The type of loan such as Conventional, FHA, etc... LTV The loan to value of the loan Loan Officer Loan Officer's name Processor Processor's name Underwriter Underwriter's name Closer Closer's name Current Milestone Field used to hold the current milestone value of the loan These are the only required fields for the template to work correctly. If you want to expand your report to include other data points then you can add those fields in as long as they are not named the same as one of the columns above. Note This dataset can be used with the template_funding.pbit as well. It is possible to point the funding and projection report at the same dataset to minimize the number of reports that need to be exported out of the LOS. Using the template Once you have your Excel file ready to go with the correct column headers and sheet name open the template_funding.pbit and you will be prompted for the file path to your Excel file. This file path must be the exact full path to the file. Example is if I have my Excel file saved to my desktop as LOS_Data.xlsx then the path I would type in is C:\\Users\\Jody\\Desktop\\LOS_Data.xlsx Once the file path is typed in click load, your data will be imported and the report will open. From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into loans that are projected to close in the time range selected. Pages in this report are intended to provide break downs based on projected units and volume for origination and operations. Branch Page This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a branch is doing. Selecting a branch from the By Branch line graph will filter the rest of the visual on the page to show how much that particular branch contributed to the whole. While you have a branch selected the Drill to Details button will become available, this will allow a user to drill to the Branch Details page which provides many of the same visual just focused on that Branch. Operations Page This page provide insight of how operations preformed based on projected loans. Clicking on one of the users in a line chart will filter the page down to show who that user will mostly be working with and what type of loans that user will be working on during that date range. Operation v2 Page This page is optional to use, it provides similar visuals as the Operations page but allows you to focus on a particular operation role instead of having all the data for all roles on the same page. Caution This page may not work very well in larger datasets as the number of users in each role may cause a larger dataset and cause the report to load slowly. Branch Details Page This page is a drill down page from the Branch page. Drilling to this page will provide projection information for the branch selected as part of the drill down. This provides information for Loan Officers found in that branch. Customization Options Projection Date In the LOS_Data table a custom column with the name of Projection Date is used to determine when a loan is projected to close. By default that column calculates the max of the Est Closing Date or the Disbursement Date fields for the loan. If your company uses some other field or calculation to project when a loan will close, updating this custom column will bring the report closer to your companies work flow. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to show dates in the last three years and two year in the furture. A custom column in the Dates table with the name of Date Range - 3 Past Years and 2 Forward is used for this filter. By changing the DAX in this field you can narrow or expand the that date range. Info Most the time when updating a columns name in Power BI, visuals and filters that use that column will automatically update.

Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into branch and users performance. Pagens in this report are intended to provided break downs based on loan milestone dates, along with providing a comparison of company averages. Branch Scorecard This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a Branch is doing. All visuals on the page but for the Funded vs Started line/bar visual, are filtered by the slicers found on the left side of the report page. The Funded vs Started line/bar visual is not affected by the Date Range slicer and will always show a rolling 12 month to date range. The total funded units and volume can be found next to the company averages by Branch. The average days measures are based on calendar weekdays. Loan Officer Scorecard This page provides information broken down on a individual Loan Officer level. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a Loan Officer is doing. All visuals on the page but for the Funded vs Started line/bar visual, are filtered by the slicers found on the left side of the report page. The Funded vs Started line/bar visual is not affected by the Date Range slicer and will always show a rolling 12 month to date range. The total funded units and volume can be found next to the company averages by Loan Officer. The average days measures are based on calendar weekdays. Loan Processor Scorecard This page provides information broken down on a individual Loan Processor level. All visuals on the page but for the Submitted to UW vs Sent to Processing line/bar visual, are filtered by the slicers found on the left side of the report page. The Submitted to UW vs Sent to Processing line/bar visual line/bar visual is not affected by the Date Range slicer and will always show a rolling 12 month to date range. The total units Sent to Processing and Submitted to UW can be found next to the company averages by Loan Processor. The average days measures are based on calendar weekdays.

The total units Sent to Closing and Funded can be found next to the company averages by Closer. The average days measures are based on calendar weekdays. Customization Options Business Days All the Milestone Date Durations columns in the LOS_Data table are based on the DAX function NETWORKDAYS . It may be more accurate to update these custom columns to exclude federal and company holidays. To do this you will need to add a holiday table to the data model and update the NETWORKDAYS part of the custom column like below: Durration - Milestone 1 to Milestone 2 = VAR _milestoneOneDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 1 Date ] VAR _milestoneTwoDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 2 Date ] VAR _duration = IF ( AND ( _milestoneOneDate , _miestoneTwoDate ), NETWORKDAYS ( _milestoneOneDate , _milestoneTwoDate , 1 , holiday_table ) - 1 , BLANK ()) RETURN IF ( _duration < 0 , BLANK (), _duration ) If you are not using the using a version of Power BI Destkop that supports the NETWORKDAYS function then you can subtitube the code in the duration columsn with the below. To use this you will need to setup a date table with the Is Weekday custom field: Durration - Milestone 1 to Milestone 2 = VAR _milestoneOneDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 1 Date ] VAR _milestoneTwoDate = LOS_Data [ Milestone 2 Date ] VAR _duration = If ( AND ( _milestoneOneDate , _milestoneTwoDate ), CALCULATE ( SUM ( Dates [ Is Weekday ]), DATESBETWEEN ( Dates [ Date ], _milestoneOneDate , _milestoneTwoDate )) - 1 , BLANK ()) RETURN If ( _duration < 0 , BLANK (), _duration ) If you plan on using the above DAX but need to also need to exclude federal and company holidays please contact me. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to only show dates in the last five years.

It may be more accurate to update these custom columns to exclude federal and company holidays.
