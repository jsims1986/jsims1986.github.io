Email: jody@simstech.dev . My Background A little background on myself and my data journey. In 2018 the mortgage company I was working for was looking to make a change away from their current reporting platform and didn't want to go back to using Excel based reports. I had looked at Microsoft Power BI before but never really had a reason to use it, so I dove in one weekend with a Excel data sheet and built out the first version of a projections report. My company loved how fast the turn around was and how customizable we could get with Power BI we decided to use Power BI as our reporting platform for the majority of our loan origination reports. Fast forward to today and I continue to build new reports and maintains over 20 reports in our Power BI platform. I truly believe that small to medium mortgage companies can have top level reporting using Power BI.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#contact-info","text":"Please feel free to reach out to me on any questions about any information found on this site or if you would like to talk about how to possible get Power BI up and going for your company.

My hope is that this report will act as a starting point to build out a Funding report that works best for your companies work flow. Download Getting Started Video Dataset Before opening the template please make sure to build out the Excel worksheet used as the Dataset for this template. Make sure that the fields are named exactly as they are listed below in the Field Name column and the sheet name in Excel is named Data . Field Information All these fields must be part of the dataset, if one of the fields listed is not something that is currently in your LOS then it is alright to use the same data point for the column. Example, if you don't have a field for your Branch name, then it would be ok to reuse the same field this is used for ORGID as the Branch data. Field Name Field Description ORGID Field used to group loans based on branch number or Cost Center Branch Field used for the name of the Branch GUID Unique identifier on a per loan bases Disbursement Date Date whcih a Loan proceeds are Funded by Lender Top Ratio Front end DTI for the loan Bottom Raio Back end DTI for the loan Est Closing Date Estimated Date the loan will close FICO The FICO score from the loan Total Loan Amount The full loan amount Funding Date The date the loan was funded Interest Rate The interest rate of the loan Loan Number The loans loan number Loan Purpose The purpose of the loan such as Purchase, Refi, etc... Loan Type The type of loan such as Conventional, FHA, etc... LTV The loan to value of the loan Loan Officer Loan Officer's name Processor Processor's name Underwriter Underwriter's name Closer Closer's name Current Milestone Field used to hold the current milestone value of the loan These are the only required fields for the template to work correctly. If you want to expand your report to include other data points then you can add those fields in as long as they are not named the same as one of the columns above. Note This dataset can be used with the template_projection.pbit as well. It is possible to point the funding and projection report at the same dataset to minimize the number of reports that need to be exported out of the LOS. Using the template Once you have your Excel file ready to go with the correct column headers and sheet name open the template_funding.pbit and you will be prompted for the file path to your Excel file. This file path must be the exact full path to the file. Example is if I have my Excel file saved to my desktop as LOS_Data.xlsx then the path I would type in is C:\\Users\\Jody\\Desktop\\LOS_Data.xlsx Once the file path is typed in click load, your data will be imported and the report will open. From here you can customize the report by swapping out fields in visuals or possible changing measures or custom fields to better suit your companies work flow. Report Pages Pages on this report are intended to provide insight into loans that have funded in the time range selected. Pages in this report are intended to provide break downs based on funded units and volume for origination and operations, along with providing a high level average statistics of funded loans. Branch Page This page provides information broken down by Branch. Toggling between Units and Volume will provide an information on how many/much of each a branch is doing. Selecting a branch from the By Branch line graph will filter the rest of the visual on the page to show how much that particular branch contributed to the whole. While you have a branch selected the Drill to Details button will become available, this will allow a user to drill to the Branch Details page which provides many of the same visual just focused on that Branch. Operations Page This page provide insight of how operations preformed based on funded loans. Clicking on one of the users in a line chart will filter the page down to show who that user mostly worked with and what type of loans that user worked on during that date range. Operation v2 Page This page is optional to use, it provides similar visuals as the Operations page but allows you to focus on a particular operation role instead of having all the data for all roles on the same page. Caution This page may not work very well in larger datasets as the number of users in each role may cause a larger dataset and cause the report to load slowly. Branch Details Page This page is a drill down page from the Branch page. Drilling to this page will provide funding information for the branch selected as part of the drill down. This provides information for Loan Officers found in that branch. Funding Stats Page This page has average characteristics for funded loans in the date range selected. A chart showing Selected Year vs Previous year for Units and Volume. Finally a Year to Date line graph provides insight of funded loans over the last 5 years. Customization Options Projection Date In the LOS_Data table a custom column with the name of Projection Date is used to determine when a loan is projected to close. By default that column calculates the max of the Est Closing Date or the Disbursement Date fields for the loan. If your company uses some other field or calculation to project when a loan will close, updating this custom column will bring the report closer to your companies work flow. Default Date Range By default all report pages have a filter applied to only show dates in the last five years. A custom column in the Dates table with the name of Date Range - 5 Years is used for this filter. By changing the DAX in this field you can narrow or expand the that date range. Info Most the time when updating a columns name in Power BI, visuals and filters that use that column will automatically update. If for some reason it doesn't simple remove the old column from the Filters pane and replace with your new column.
